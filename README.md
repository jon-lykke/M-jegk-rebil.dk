This little webpage is essentially a calcultor helping people to find out, after a night out or generally after consuming alcohol, if they are sober enough to legally operate a vehicle.
The webpage uses Widmarks formula for blood alcohol content ([Alcohol consumed in grams / (body weight in grams * r)] * 100 where "r" is the gender constant (men: 0.68% water, women: 0.55% water)).

Note: This calculator uses the current laws in Denmark to determine what's legal and what is not, but this differs a lot from country to country. In Denmark it is legal to operate a vehicle if your blood alcohol content level is 0.5 per mille or lower.
If you are using this webpage outside Denmark, or just generally want to be on the safe side, your blood alcohol content level should be zero.
